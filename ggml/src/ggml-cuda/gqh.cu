// Do not try to buy DEPTH == 4 by moving the activation prefetch after the fold to free

// **This is a fit on five shapes of one model, and it is deliberately biased.** The
// threshold below now sits between 6144 and 10240 rows (it was between 12288 and 17408
// while the ROWS == 1 arm was one superblock deep); nothing measured here pins it
// inside that interval, and neither hot_ms nor the greedy-sha gate can falsify it.
// It is therefore written as the NARROW EXCEPTION: a shape has to clear
// GQH_ROWS1_ROUNDS full occupancy rounds before it takes the ROWS == 1 arm, so any
// shape this table does not cover lands on the ROWS == 4 plateau instead of on the arm
// that can regress 13%. Scoped to GQH4 for the same reason -- the sweep was
// GQH4-only, and GQH3/GQH2_H measured flat across ROWS (2.47 -> 2.44 ms) so they have
// nothing to gain from being included and a shape-dependent regression to lose.
//
// **The table above is iteration 5's, taken when the ROWS == 1 arm was DEPTH == 1 and
// ran at 510 GB/s. Iterations 7-8 took that arm to 565 GB/s, which moved the crossover
// two buckets down -- see GQH_ROWS1_ROUNDS, re-measured per bucket in iteration 9.**

// and out == 12288 are stale.

//     16384 and cost 1.2 ms. (That regression was iteration 5's, when the ROWS == 1
//     arm was DEPTH == 1; at DEPTH == 3 out == 10240 and out == 12288 are FASTER on
//     that arm and the threshold is deliberately 10240 now. The lesson survives the

// (ceil(waves/resident) / (waves/resident)) and C is a per-DISPATCH fixed cost of

// loop is finished -- every remaining microsecond is C or q, and both are properties of
// the DISPATCH, not of the loop body. This is the one change that attacks both at once,
// on the biggest bucket in the model:
//
//   ffn gate and ffn up are 126 of the 298 GQH4 dispatches per N=1 forward (10.64 ms,
//   47% of all matvec time). Both are out == 17408, in == 5120, and they read the SAME
//   activation. 17408 rows at one row per warp is 8.5 occupancy rounds against 2048
//   resident waves -- a fractional round, the only fractional one on the ROWS == 1 arm
//   (out == 10240 and 12288 are exactly 5.0 and 6.0). Folding the pair into one
//   dispatch of 2 x 4352 blocks makes it 34816 waves = 17.0 rounds EXACTLY, and pays C
//   once for the layer instead of twice.
//
// Do NOT try to buy the same thing by cutting occupancy so the wave count divides
// evenly (16 KB of LDS caps residency at 1024 waves and makes 17408 a whole 17 rounds):
// measured, the whole-round control buckets out == 10240 / 12288 lose 10% of their
// bandwidth to the halved residency, which swamps the 5.9% the quantisation is worth.
